## Notes 
I'm new to IOS and mobile development in general and it took me a while to get familiarized with Swift and Xcode. The tutorial was simple but working on your own with no experience can be tricky. Still I tool a crack at a few of the bonus features and implemented one from the examples that I liked. There are still plenty more that I'd like to add and I will continue working on this app whenever I can.
